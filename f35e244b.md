Freethough is an epistemological viewpoint which holds that beliefs should not
be derived from authority, tradition, or religious dogma. **Free thinker** is
a person who thinks independently and form conclusions based on empirical
evidences, logic, and reason, rather than accepting ideas and opinions of those
of other people, especially of religious thinking.[^1]
